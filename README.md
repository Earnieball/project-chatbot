# Project Name

Beer-Bot

The assignment was to create a chatbot about anything we wanted it to be about. We chose to make our chatbot about beer which we both really like. 
## The problem

First of all we made a plan of what we where looking at doing. Then we made a rough design of the bot in Figma so that we were both on the same page as to what we were aiming at the bot looking like. 
We then set about trying to code in our buttons first in HTML and then in javascript. We spent days trying to figure this out without much success. We then turned to the INTERNET where we used everything from w3schools to past technigo projects in Stack Overflow. After many sleepless nights and banging our heads to the wall we finally managed to find solutions that worked for our specific project. 

Also, we had some issues in the beginning with github, unable to 'add ., -commit" properly. We got some help with this in the lecture with Daniel. That's why our commits in this project might look a little funky. 

If we had more time we would add some pictures to the selection-buttons and have the 'enter' function in our chat. As it is now you have to press the 'Send' button in order for the chat to work properly. 
We would've also liked to have a return-button to clear the bot and go back to the menu.
